This folder is influnced from react components so basically what we are doing here is, We used to create seperate folders like controller, model, middlewares etc. but in this type of approach we make different files like file.controller.js, file.model.js etc for each entities instead of grouping them together. So If there's something wrong with an entity then we just change into that entity and it won't affect rest of the code.
